The CVE-2023-25194 detection tool utilizes JNDI to load the response content returned by the DNS log platform to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. The logic for determining the response content involves successful utilization of the content received through testing. Some response contents can establish connections with the target via the DNS log platform, but they are ultimately ignored as they cannot be exploited.

usage: CVE-2023-25194_Scan.py [-h] (-u URL | -f FILE)

Send POST requests to URLs

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     URL, Single target detection
  -f FILE, --file FILE  URL File, Batch scan

```

Single target exploitation

```
python3 CVE-2023-25194_Scan.py -u http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Batch target scanning

The URLs with vulnerabilities will be stored in the file "result.txt" in the current directory.

```
python3 CVE-2023-25194_Scan.py -f url.txt
```

If necessary, you can modify the actual DNS log platform address in line 34 of the code. However, not changing it will not affect the program's execution.
